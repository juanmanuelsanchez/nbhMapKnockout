# nbhMapKnockout

## Project Description
  --------------------
Creates an interactive neighbourhood map with some Sushi restaurant suggestions 
taken from Foursquare API, following the MVVM design pattern as proposed by KnockoutJS.

## Instructions to run the program
  ---------------------------------
Click the index.html file to run the program. A map will show you some markers with Sushi
restaurant suggestions selected from Foursquare. There's a listview header above the map
with a + sign on it. When clicked it'll display the listview with the names of the restaurants
suggestions that appear as markers on the map. These names are clickable and when clicked the
map will show additional information about the clicked item as an info window above the marker.
Additionally, there a search bar on the top where you can filter the suggested items to be 
shown individually on the map. 


## Packages
  ---------
* _src_ folder contains the development version of the program, which is run by default when
  index.html is clicked as mentioned above.
* _dist_ folder contains the production version of the code, to be placed on the server.
